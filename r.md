# R Help

_R_, as noted on its website, is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It could be used and accessed on any operating system. _R_ is a command based program, meaning that you will be creating and running _R_ code (or scripts) for all the statistical analysis you will be performing. A portion of class time will be spent in _R_ lab sessions. 


_RStudio_ is a user interface program for _R_. It makes the use of _R_ more straightforward. However, _R_ does have a steep learning curve, but example code for all the types of analyses that you will be required to do will be provided.

For help with (very likely) all of your _R_ related questions, go to [Quick R](http://www.statmethods.net). Additional help will be provided in class and on this web page.
