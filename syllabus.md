# Course Description

From the course catalog: _An introduction to the techniques and strategies researchers in politics use to study and understand the political world._ 

This is an undergraduate course in social science research methods and data analysis.  It is designed to introduce you to the use of political analysis, begin an exploration in the exciting worlds of quantitative research methods, and help you practice basic analytical methods for understanding political and social phenomena. 

In addition and as stated in the Kellstedt and Whitten text, this course will help prepare you to 1) consume academic political science research in your other courses, 2) become a better consumer of information, and 3) start you on the road to becoming a producer of scientific research. We will cover a lot of material in this course, __therefore it is imperative that you come to class having done the readings and prepared to participate__. 

As we progress, we will spend part of the semester on the tools and techniques of quality research design; the basic statistical skills that give you an understanding of the appropriate uses and mis--uses of these tools and techniques; and on finally we will learn to do data analysis in _R_, a statistical programming language. 

In the first part of the course we will review the features of science, the scientific method, and core concepts in empirical research. Topics include theory development, how to formulate hypotheses, and how political scientists think about causality. The first section is intended to enhance your critical and social scientific thinking skills while also helping you distinguish between scholarly and non-scholarly research. The next section introduces students to the components of a research design. We will cover the features of experimental and non-experimental designs, review the fundamentals of statistical inference, and cover survey research. This section is intended to provide you with a working knowledge of the methods used by academic political scientists and help you design your own research. The third part of the course will focus on "doing" research and we will have several lab sessions where we will be performing data analysis using the statistical programming language _R_. Topics will include the exploring and visualizing of data and examining relationships between two variables. Finally, we will discuss and learn how to apply Ordinary Least Squares regression, the "workhorse" of empirical social science research, to test hypotheses. 

__NOTE__: This classroom is equipped with computer at each workshop, however we will only use the computer on certain days and for specific purposes. Therefore, __the computers must remain off unless we are using them for class__. In addition, __all phones and laptops must remain put away__ unless you are asked to use them for class purposes. _Notes should be taken by hand, with pen and paper_. [You learn better that way](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-learning-secret-don-t-take-notes-with-a-laptop/).

I recommend taking notes using the [Cornell Method](http://www.usu.edu/arc/idea_sheets/pdf/note_taking_cornell.pdf)

# Course Goals and Learning Objectives

The goals for this course are to:

* Identify and explain current academic research projects in politics.
* Enhance critical and social scientific thinking skills to distinguish between scholarly and non--scholarly approaches.
* Develop research questions that are answerable with a variety of methods. 
* Demonstrate some of the methods used by scholars of politics. 
* Develop skills in designing a research project. 

# Required Textbook

The following book is required and _additional readings will be
provided on [OAKS](https://lms.cofc.edu/)_

__KW__: Kellstedt, Paul M. and Guy D. Whitten. 2013. _The Fundamentals of Political Science Research_. Cambridge University Press. 2nd Ed. 

# Required Software

You are also required to download _R_ and _RStudio_ on your home computer and/or laptop. Both programs are open-source and available at no cost. In addition, both are available on the computers in the classroom. For more information and instructions for downloading _R_ and _RStudio_ go to the [R Help](http://matthewcnowlin.com/poli205/r.html) section of the course website.

While not required, I strongly recommend the use of citation manager software such as [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) or [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com). 

# Course Requirements and Grading

Performance in this course will be evaluated on the basis of a research design, ten reading quizzes, four in--class lab assignments, four homework assignments, and a comprehensive final exam. 

Points will be distributed as follows:

Assignment | Points Possible
--- | ---
Research Design  | 300 points (total)
10 Reading Quizzes (20 pts each) | 200 points
Data Analysis Project | 200 points 
4 In--class Lab Assignments (25 pts each)  | 100 points 
4 Homework Assignments (25 pts each) | 100 points 
Final Exam | 100 points 
--- | ---
__Total__ | __1000 points__


Specific requirements for each assignment will be available on the [course website](http://matthewcnowlin.com/poli205) and discussed in class. _You must be present during the in--class lab assignments to receive credit, no make-ups will be allowed_.

__NO LATE WORK WILL BE ACCEPTED__

## Cheating or Plagiarism:
A grade of zero will be given to anyone cheating on any exam, homework
assignment or committing plagiarism in a paper. As commonly defined,
plagiarism consists of passing off as ones own ideas, the words,
writings, music, graphs/charts, etc that were created by another. In
accordance with this definition, you are committing plagiarism if you
copy the work of another person and turn it in as your own, even if
you have the permission of that person.  It does not matter from where
the material is borrowed–a book, article, material off the web,
another student’s paper–all constitute plagiarism unless the source of
the work is fully identified and credited. Plagiarism is cheating and
a violation of academic and personal integrity and will not be
tolerated.  It carries extremely serious consequences.  To avoid
plagiarism it is necessary when using a phrase, a distinctive idea,
concept or sentence from another source to reference that source in
your text, a footnote, or end-note.  Please contact me if you need
assistance in citing a source. 

For more information on plagiarism see the [library website](http://libguides.library.cofc.edu/c.php?g=230844&p=1531392) 

## Center for Student Learning
I encourage you to utilize the Center for Student Learning’s (CSL) academic support services for assistance in study strategies, speaking & writing skills, and course content. They offer tutoring, Supplemental Instruction, study skills appointments, and workshops. Students of all abilities have become more successful using these programs throughout their academic career and the services are available to you at no additional cost. For more information regarding these services please visit the CSL [website](http://csl.cofc.edu) or call (843)953-5635.

## Students with Disabilities:
The College will make reasonable accommodations for persons with
documented disabilities. Students should apply at the [Center for
Disability Services](http://disabilityservices.cofc.edu/) located on the first floor of the Lightsey Center, Suite 104. Students approved for accommodations are responsible for notifying me as soon as possible and for contacting me at least one week before any accommodation is needed. 
 

## Religious Holiday Policy:
It is the policy of the College to excuse absences of students that
result from religious observances and to provide without penalty for
the rescheduling of examinations and additional required class work
that may fall on religious holidays.  Please see me
immediately if you will need to miss class any time during this
semester.
