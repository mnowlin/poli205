title: Research Design 
---

Each part of the research design will be due in the dropbox on [OAKS](https://lms.cofc.edu/) __before class__ on the due date.

## Requirements

Your research design should follow this outline.

Paper length should be about 12 to 15 pages, double-spaced, 1in margins, and 12pt Times New Roman font. 

__USE CHAPTER 12 of KELLSTEDT AND WHITTEN AS A GUIDE__ 

### Part I. Introduction and Literature Review

A draft of the introduction and literature is due before class on _October 27th_. _Should be 5-6 pages, not including the reference page_ 

Follow guideline available on [OAKS](https://lms.cofc.edu/) under Handouts

* Introduction
    * _Two to three paragraphs about research topic_ 
    * _Must include research question_ 

* Literature Review
    * _Summarize what previous research says about your topic, research question, and/or dependent variable._ 
    * _Should be 4-5 pages (double spaced) and include 6 peer-reviewed journal articles_ 

### Part II. Theory and Hypotheses 

A draft of the theory and hypotheses section is due before class on _November 3rd_ in [OAKS](https://lms.cofc.edu/) in the dropbox labeled homework 3. _Should be 1 and 1/2 to 2 pages (double spaced)_.

The theory section should explain the theory that you plan on developing and testing. It could be original or another theory that you are applying in a different context. 

Look again at KW Chapter's 2 and 3, as well your notes, and the lecture slides. 

* Theory
    * _Four to five paragraphs_  
    * _Identify your dependent variable conceptually_
    * _Identify your independent variable conceptually_ 
    * _Discuss the causal link between the IV and the DV. Specifically address what it is about a change in the IV that causes a change in the DV_

* Hypotheses
    * _One paragraph that leads from the theory to the hypothesis_ 
    * _Clearly state at least one directional hypothesis drawn for the theory in the following form_:
        * H1: As IV changes (specify direction) the DV changes (specify direction)

### Part III. Data and Methods

The data and methods section should explain the specific research design, how you are measuring your concepts, how you will collect your data, and how you will analyze your data.

This section should be about 3 to 4 pages (double spaced). 

Note: if you are using a qualitative approach see the Silverman Chap 2 and Flick Chap 12 readings on [OAKS](https://lms.cofc.edu/). 

Look at the lecture slides and your notes to determine the specific research design. 

* Design
    * _About a 1 and 1/2 to 2 pages_
    * _Identify how you are measuring your concepts_. _Explain how that measure is both valid and reliable_.  
    * _Identify whether your approach an experiment or is it observational data_? 
        * _If experiment what is your treatment (X)?_  
        * _If observational is it large-n or small-n? Cross-sectional or time series_? 

* Data Collection and Variables 
    * _About a page_
    * _Identify how you would collect your data, including potential data sources_. 
        * For a list of possible quantitative data sources see Dr. Ragusa's [webpage](http://jordanragusa.com/data.html). 
        * If you are planning to create a public opinion survey search for questions related to your topic using the _iPoll_ database. Go to the CofC [library webpage](http://libguides.library.cofc.edu/az.php?a=i) and scroll down to iPoll.  
    * _If using an observational design identify your control (Z) variables, including-in a sentence or two-why you need to control for them and how they will be measured_.
     
* Analysis
    * _About 1 to 1 and 1/2 pages_ 
    * _Identify how you will use your data to test your hypothesis_.
        * If you are using quantitative data, what statistical tests will you use and why? 

### Part IV. Conclusion

* Conclusion
    * _About 1 to 1 and 1/2 pages (double spaced)_
    * _In 2 to 3 paragraphs, identify what you expect to find if you actually do the analysis that you proposed_
    * _In 1 to 2 paragraphs, relate these expected findings back to your research question, theory, and hypothesis_ 
    * _In the final paragraph suggest a direction for future research_ 

* __References__ 
    * _List each source you cited on a separate page_
    * _Citation style not important as long as you are consistent_
