title: Research Design 
---

Each part of the research design will be due in the dropbox on [OAKS](https://lms.cofc.edu/) __before class__ on the due date.

## Requirements

Your research design should follow this outline.

Paper length should be about 12 to 15 pages, double-spaced, 1in margins, and 12pt Times New Roman font. 

__USE CHAPTER 12 of KELLSTEDT AND WHITTEN AS A GUIDE__ 

### Part I. Introduction and Literature Review

A draft of the introduction and literature is due before class on _October 27th_. _Should be 5-6 pages, not including the reference page_ 

Follow guideline available on [OAKS](https://lms.cofc.edu/) under Handouts

* Introduction
    * _Two to three paragraphs about research topic_ 
    * _Must include research question_ 

* Literature Review
    * _Summarize what previous research says about your topic, research question, and/or dependent variable._ 
    * _Should be 4-5 pages (double spaced) and include 6 peer-reviewed journal articles_ 

* References
    * _List each source you cited on a separate page_
    * _Citation style not important as long as you are consistent_

### Part II. Theory and Hypotheses 

A draft of the theory and hypotheses section is due before class on _November 3rd_ in [OAKS](https://lms.cofc.edu/) in the dropbox labeled homework 3. _Should be 1 and 1/5 to 2 pages (double spaced)_.

The theory section should explain the theory that you plan on developing and testing. It could be original or another theory that you are applying in a different context. 

Look again at KW Chapter's 2 and 3, as well your notes, and the lecture slides. 

* Theory
    * _Four to five paragraphs_  
    * _Identify your dependent variable conceptually_
    * _Identify your independent variable conceptually_ 
    * _Discuss the causal link between the IV and the DV. Specifically address what it is about a change in the IV that causes a change in the DV_

* Hypotheses
    * _One paragraph that leads from the theory to the hypothesis_ 
    * _Clearly state at least one directional hypothesis drawn for the theory in the following form_:
        * H1: As IV changes (specify direction) the DV changes (specify direction)
