title: Reading Quizzes
---

Given the amount of material we will cover in this course, it is imperative that you keep up with the readings. To help facilitate this, there will be 10 readings quizzes, roughly one for each chapter we will cover in the _Kellstedt and Whitten_ book. These quizzes will have 5 multiple choice questions taken from the readings.

You will take the quizzes through [OAKS](https://lms.cofc.edu/) and they will only be available for a short time. Missed quizzes __can NOT be made up__. Once you begin, you will have __15 minutes__ to complete each quiz.
