### Picking A Research Topic

For homework 1 you are required to find a research topic that is of interest to you and _one_ peer-reviewed journal article about that topic. This will be your topic as we progress throughout the semester. 

See the [library website](http://libguides.library.cofc.edu/c.php?g=230844&p=1533020) for help with picking a topic. 

Specifically you should: 

* 1) Describe your research topic in about a paragraph. This paragraph should include a _research question_. Note, that the research questions can be refined later.

* 2) Find a peer-reviewed journal article this deals with your topic of interest and summarize that article using the _reference worksheets_ on [OAKS]():
    * Research Question: 
    * Theory:
    * Hypotheses:
    * Data:
    * Analysis:
    * Results:
    * Conclusion:
