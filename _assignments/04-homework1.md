### Picking A Research Topic

For homework 1 you are required to find a research topic that is of interest to you and _one_ peer-reviewed journal article about that topic. This will be your topic as we progress throughout the semester.

Note that the choice of topic is open, it just needs to be some social and/or political phenomena. Topics could include (but are not limited too) political institutions, elections, international relations, comparative politics, or policy issues (e.g., the death penalty, climate change, gun violence). 

If needed, see the [library website](http://libguides.library.cofc.edu/c.php?g=230844&p=1533020) for help with picking a topic. 

Specifically you should: 

1) Describe your research topic in about a paragraph. This paragraph should include a _research question_. Note, that the research questions can be refined later.

2) Find a peer-reviewed journal article this deals with your topic of interest and summarize that article using the _reference worksheet_ on [OAKS](https://lms.cofc.edu). To complete the worksheet you will need to identify the following from the article:

* Research Question: 
* Theory:
* Hypotheses:
* Data:
* Analysis:
* Results:
* Conclusion: 

__PLACE THE TOPIC PARAGRAPH, REFERENCE WORKSHEET, AND A PDF OF THE JOURNAL ARTICLE IN THE DROPBOX ON [OAKS](https://lms.cofc.edu)__
